Set of XCM tools for Polkadot and Kusama Paraverse
</h3>

## 🧰 This is what we are working on:
- [XCM SDK](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/packages/sdk): A tool designed to unify the cross-chain experience on Polkadot and serve as a layer 2 protocol that enables seamless integration of XCM into your decentralized applications.
- [XCM API](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/apps/xcm-api) (LightSpell⚡️): An API that provides the ability to integrate XCM interoperability into your decentralized application in package-less way offloading heavy computing tasks from your decentralized application, and reducing associated costs.
- [XCM ROUTER](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/packages/xcm-router) (SpellRouter☄️): A tool aiming to provide the capability of cross-chain swaps where you receive different assets than those you send (e.g. send DOT from Polkadot and receive ASTR on Astar) — all within a single command.
- [XCM Analyser](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/packages/xcm-analyser) - Analyser package to convert XCM Multilocations into a human-readable format.
- [XCM Visualizator](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/apps/visualizator-fe) - An application developed to visualize XCM within the Polkadot ecosystem.

All of our tools are **completely free** and **fully open source** 🧙‍♂️🪄
