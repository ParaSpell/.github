🧰 What we are working on:
- XCM SDK: Meant to unify cross-chain experience on Polkadot and become layer 2 protocol that allows for seamless integration of XCM into your dApps
- XCM UI: Meant to allow users experience cross-chain transfers through XCM, allow parachain developers to test their Parachains and allow developers to see an example of dApp integrating our XCM SDK.
